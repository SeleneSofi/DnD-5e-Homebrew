				"A symphony of deadly notes is played from your bardic instrument, directly afecting the mind of a creature you can see within range. The creature is afected even if it can't hear the symphony. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the target takes {@damage 2d8} psychic damage, and the spell ends. On a failed save, the target takes {@damage 4d8} psychic damage, and until the spell ends, you can use your action on each of your turns to automatically deal {@damage 4d8} psychic damage to the target. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else, if the target is ever outside the spell's range, or if the target leave your sight. If the target take damage this way, at the start of its next turn it must roll a {@dice d8} to determine how its sanity will be affected that turn.",
